# Godot 4 Ocean Shader
An early work in progress ocean shader for Godot 4 base on Jerry Tessendorf's
FFT method for generating the waves, using compute shaders to generate the
displacement map.

The GLSL shaders that generates the displacement map were ported into Godot 4
from [this project](https://github.com/achalpandeyy/OceanFFT). The underlying
math is identical, but some things like binding points and how uniforms were
accessed had to be changed to work in Godots compute shader API.

Press the `/~ key while running the example scene to toggle the debug texture
views for the displacement and normal maps.

## Todo List
- Improve visual rendering
  - Foam
  - Splash particles
  - Light interactions (transparency, refractions)
- Improve quad tree LOD transitions, and lower detail but faster visual shader for lower LOD quads
- Improve buoyancy system for large objects
- Cascading FFTs
- Multiplayer synchronization? [This reference](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/assets/gameworks/downloads/regular/events/cgdc15/CGDC2015_ocean_simulation_en.pdf) may be helpful for this.
